### [The Register-Guard](http://registerguard.com)'s 3rd party sub-theme.

#### ABOUT

Nine times out of ten, 3rd party websites are unpredictable and they're almost always inflexible. We've learned over the years that its best to have a super simple template for use within these systems. Yadda yadda yadda (I'll be back to clean up this verbiage later).

---

#### FEATURES

Blah blah, here's yadda information for xyz:

* HTML4 strict (a lot of 3rd parties will frack with DTD, and I have yet to see any that use an HTML5 document type.)
* Simple CSS/HTML.
* Basic styling of core elements.
* Easy to sub-theme and extend.
* Easy to change container width.
* Other?
