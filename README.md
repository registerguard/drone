### [The Register-Guard](http://registerguard.com)'s 3rd party sub-theme.

#### ABOUT

Nine times out of ten, 3rd party websites are unpredictable and they're almost always inflexible. We've learned over the years that its best to have a super simple template for use within these systems. Yadda yadda yadda (I'll be back to clean up this verbiage later).

---

#### FEATURES

* HTML4 strict (a lot of 3rd parties will frack with DTD, and I have yet to see any that use an HTML5 document type.)
* Simple CSS/HTML.
* Basic styling of core elements.
* Easy to sub-theme and extend.
* Easy to change container width.
* Other?

#### CLIENT-SPECIFIC DETAILS

**Adicio:**
1. Using a `<table>` to wrap the `primary` content (*this should not harm other 3rd parties, so is built into the default*)


```html
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<!-- Note: The table is only for Adicio hosted templates. -->
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```
