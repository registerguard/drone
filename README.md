#### ABOUT

Nine times out of ten, 3rd party websites are unpredictable and they're almost always inflexible. We've learned over the years that its best to have a super simple template for use within these systems. Yadda yadda yadda (I'll be back to clean up this verbiage later).

---

#### FEATURES

* HTML4 strict (a lot of 3rd parties will frack with DTD, and I have yet to see any that use an HTML5 document type.)
* Simple CSS/HTML.
* Basic styling of core elements.
* Easy to sub-theme and extend.
* Easy to change container width.
* Namespaced.

**Important:** This theme's sole purpose is to wrap 3rd party conent. If one needs to include additional styles, for additional "theme" styles, then one should include/organize/version those via other means.

---

#### TRICK(S)

1. Using a `<table>` to wrap the `primary` content; This fixes any potentially bad HTML generated by 3rd party:


```html
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<!-- 3rd party content here. -->
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```
